# Spotter AI - Website UI Clone Assessment

This project is a UI clone of the Spotter AI website's main landing page and a specific interactive modal, developed as an assessment for the Website Developer & Manager position. The goal was to replicate the aesthetic and functionality of a given UI (inspired by fingerprint.com's demo modal) while incorporating Spotter AI's branding.
